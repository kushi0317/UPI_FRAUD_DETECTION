# üí≥ UPI Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## üìå Abstract

- With the rapid increase in UPI usage for online payments, the number of fraudulent activities is also rising.
- UPI frauds pose a serious threat to financial security and can cause significant losses to both users and financial institutions.
- This project explores how Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and machine learning techniques can be used to detect fraud in UPI transactions.
- Initially, an HMM is trained for a cardholder‚Äôs transaction pattern. If a transaction deviates significantly from the learned behavior, it is flagged as fraudulent.
- Along with HMM, we implemented and compared 5 different machine learning algorithms to detect UPI fraud, analyzing their accuracy and effectiveness.

## üß© Problem Definition

- Real-world UPI fraud detection is challenging due to the unavailability of public, labeled transaction datasets.
- Financial data is sensitive and must be kept confidential to maintain user privacy.
- Data often contains **noise**, such as incorrect or inconsistent records, which hampers model accuracy.
- Due to this noise, generalization becomes difficult no matter how extensive the training set is.
- A robust approach is required to handle such issues while still providing accurate detection of fraud.

## ‚úÖ Advantages

- Offers **high security** against unauthorized use of UPI.
- Prevents fraudulent use of card or UPI credentials in online transactions.
- Detects if a card/UPI is being used by unauthorized users, e.g., when a card is lost.

## üß™ Methodology

- Multiple models were trained and evaluated including:
  - Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
- The dataset was preprocessed to handle class imbalance and noise.
- Each algorithm was tested, and accuracy scores were recorded and compared.
